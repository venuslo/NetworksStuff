How to run code:
1.  Copy and paste the data from the website to a file called HW1_data.txt (included in the zip file)
2.  Run ``python code.py''

Output:
1.  The required files
2.  I will output the number of nodes in the graph, the number of edges, and a list of all the files that couldn't be read properly.

Handling data:
1.  Any line on the bibliograph that did not follow the format in the assignment were ignored.  Overall, this amounted to 80 nodes compared to 30,000+ nodes created, less than 1% loss in the number of nodes.  So this shouldn't affect the network structure much.  At the very least, it would have a very small effect in the percentage of isolated nodes, since 3800+ nodes are isolated.  The addition of 80 nodes, which are unlikely to have high degree as researchers do not work in big teams, should not affect the number of low-degree nodes.

2.  An except to note 1 above is that if names are followed by (.Ed), I assumed this meant editor or main researcher or something, and just deleted this from their name to include them as an author.  This might add an edge or so (this was rare anyways), so again shouldn't affect the network.
